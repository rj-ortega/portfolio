Hello! I'm a software developer who graduated from Flatiron Schools and is looking for a job in the Denver area. I enjoy losing track of time coding, playing games, climbing things, and long walks on the beach.

### Full Bio

Hello again! So, I was born and raised in Venezuela and I came to the US when I was 14 years old. Not knowing how to speak english very well, I struggled through high school. But eventually I finished it, made some friends, and was actually able to picture living in the US instead of constantly wanting to go back home.

The next step was to move on to college to pursue a career. It was quickly obvious that it wasn’t working out, I dropped out of college after a year and I assumed that I didn’t have an aptitude for Computer Science -- even though the reason I dropped out was because I never went to class and spent all my time playing intramural sports, partying and playing WoW. Little did I know, Computer Science was definitely the right choice, just the wrong time in my life.

I ended up working at a supermarket, I hated it, so went back to college and actually graduated this time around, with a double major in Psychology and Modern Languages. I thought I was on the right path… Fast forward a few years. I bounced from job to job, tried different professions, tried working indoors, outdoors, full-time, seasonal jobs, even managaed to stay at a couple for almost two years... But so far, I only found happiness in hobbies: video games, camping, climbing, hiking, anime, travelling the world, etc.

Eventually, I stumble into coding. My brother did a career switch through a code school so after trying to learn it out on my own, I decide it’s time to join a bootcamp as well and give it a real shot. Now, I’ve found a passion for coding and can’t wait to keep growing professionally, keep problem solving and face the many challenges ahead.

Thanks for reading!
